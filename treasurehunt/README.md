# General Info

Welcome to my treasure hunt github!

Some information before you go the live site:
- Authorizations restrict to one player profile so you may see that you don't start in room 0 and may already have items or gold.
- If you have items you want to sell, you need to discover the SHOP which is in room 1.
- Each users map progress is separate through local storage.
- Clicking "Auto", will automate dungeon exploration and treasure collection.
- You cannot travel to rooms you haven't discovered yet.
